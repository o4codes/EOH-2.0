AGNUS DEI (WITH HOW GREAT THOU ART)

Alleluia, alleluia, for the Lord God Almighty reigns.
Alleluia, alleluia
Holy, Holy, are You Lord God Almighty.
Worthy is the Lamb, worthy is the Lamb,
You are holy, holy are You Lord God Almighty.
Worthy is the Lamb, worthy is the Lamb,
Worthy is the Lamb

O lord my God, when I in awesome wonder
Consider all the worlds Thy hands have made;
I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder,
Thy power throughout the universe displayed.

Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, how great Thou art.
Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, how great Thou art!

Holy, holy, are You Lord God Almighty.
Worthy is the Lamb, How great thou art,
Worthy is the Lamb, How great thou art,

Holy, holy, are You Lord God Almighty.
Worthy is the Lamb, worthy is the Lamb,
Worthy is the Lamb, How Great thou art,

How Great thou art! (Worthy is the Lamb)
Amen
