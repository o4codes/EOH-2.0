Cross of Jesus Cross of Sorrow

1 Cross of Jesus, cross of sorrow,
where the blood of Christ was shed,
perfect man on thee did suffer,
perfect God on thee has bled!

2 Here the King of all the ages,
throned in light ere worlds could be,
robed in mortal flesh is dying,
crucified by sin for me.

3 O mysterious condescending!
O abandonment sublime!
Very God Himself is bearing
all the sufferings of time!

4 Cross of Jesus, cross of sorrow,
where the blood of Christ was shed,
perfect man on thee did suffer,
perfect God on thee has bled!
