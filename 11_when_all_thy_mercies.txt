WHEN ALL THY MERCIES, O MY GOD

1. When all Thy mercies, O my God,
   My rising soul surveys,
   Transported with the view, I'm lost
   In wonder, love, and praise.

2. Unnumbered comforts to my soul
   Thy tender care bestowed,
   Before my infant heart conceived
   From whom those comforts flowed.

3. When worn with sickness, oft hast Thou
   With health renewed my face;
   And when in sins and sorrows sunk,
   Revived my soul with grace.

4. Thy bounteous hand with worldly bliss
   Has made my cup run o'er;
   And in a kind and faithful friend
   Has doubled all my store.

5. Ten thousand thousand precious gifts
   My daily thanks employ;
   Nor is the least a cheerful heart
   That tastes those gifts with joy.

6. Through every period of my life
   Thy goodness I'll pursue;
   And after death, in distant worlds,
   I'll praise Thee evermore.

7. Through all eternity to Thee
   A joyful song I'll raise;
   For O, eternity's too short
   To utter all Thy praise!
