THE STRIFE IS OVER

The strife is o'er, the battle done;
Now is the Victor's triumph won;
O let the song of praise be sung:
Alleluia!

Death's mightiest powers have done their worst,
And Jesus hath His foes dispersed;
Let shouts of praise and joy outburst:
Alleluia!

On the third morn He rose again
Glorious in majesty to reign;
O let us swell the joyful strain:
Alleluia!

Lord, by the stripes which wounded Thee
From death's dread sting Thy servants free,
That we may live and sing to Thee:
Alleluia!

Amen.
