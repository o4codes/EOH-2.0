// Oh, To See The Dawn (The Power Of The Cross)
// Stuart Townend & Keith Getty

Verse 1:
Oh, to see the dawn of the darkest day
Christ on the road to Calvary
Tried by sinful men, torn and beaten, then
Nailed to a cross of wood

Verse 2:
Oh, to see the pain written on Your face
Bearing the awesome weight of sin
Every bitter thought, every evil deed
Crowning Your bloodstained brow

Verse 3:
Now the daylight flees, now the ground beneath
Quakes as its Maker bows His head
Curtain torn in two, dead are raised to life
"Finished!" the victory cry

Verse 4:
Oh, to see my name written in the wounds
For through Your suffering I am free
Death is crushed to death, life is mine to live
Won through Your selfless love

Chorus:
This, the power of the cross
Christ became sin for us
Took the blame, bore the wrath
We stand forgiven at the cross
