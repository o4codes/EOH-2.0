St. Cecilia Anthem

O saint Cecilia, virgin crowned in virtue,
your melodious accents celebrated the praise of God.
Your heart burned with the fire of love and humility,
that we may unite in concert praise to bless Christ the Lord.
We lift our voices, high in praises, we lift our voices high in praise,
help us to be one in Christ, 
O st. Cecilia, pray for us.

Amen
