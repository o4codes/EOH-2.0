WHAT GRACE IS MINE (LLOYD LARSON)

What grace is mine that He who dwells in endless light
Called through the night to find my distant soul?
And from His scars poured mercy that would plead for me
That I might live and in His name be known.

CHORUS
So I will go wherever He is calling me
I lose my life to find my life in Him.
I give my all to gain the hope that never dies
I bow my heart, take up my cross and follow Him.


What grace is mine to know His breath alive in me
Beneath His wings my wakened soul may soar?
All fear can flee for death's dark night is overcome
My Savior lives and reigns forevermore.
